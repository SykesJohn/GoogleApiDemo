# GoogleApiDemo
This is a sample app that tries to do thesame thing in both server and client side Blazor and make calls the the GoogleApi NuGet package.
You will need to add your Google API key in the 2 appsettings.json file to use it.

Maybe HttpClientHandler can be replaced with HttpClient? This would make the GoogleApi klibrary work on the client side.
